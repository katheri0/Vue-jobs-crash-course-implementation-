the Study Curve (Phases)

1. Analysis & Documentation (done ✅)

-finished the MVP database schema + relationships.

-Documented future extensions.

knowing the “minimum” product scope.

👉 Output: Requirements + schema docs.
_________
2. Design Phase (current 📍)

-Learn Figma → build wireframes (UI flow, mockups).

-Map user journeys (seeker flow, recruiter flow, admin flow).

-Define UI/UX standards (colors, fonts, layout).

👉 Output: Clickable prototype + design system.
_________

3. Implementation Phase (next)

-Learn Laravel basics: routing, controllers, migrations, Eloquent.

-Learn frontend basics: Blade templates, maybe React/Vue later.

-Start coding core MVP features → users, jobs, applications.

👉 Output: Working MVP (CRUD with real DB).
_________

4. Testing & Integration Phase

-Unit testing (Laravel phpunit).

-Integration testing (DB + frontend).

-Manual test flows (login → apply to job → recruiter sees application).

-Fix bugs, refine logic.

👉 Output: Stable app.
_________

5. Deployment Phase

-Learn server basics (Linux hosting, Apache/Nginx).

-Deploy with Laravel Forge, Docker, or shared hosting.

-Configure DB in production.

-Add monitoring + backups.

👉 Output: Publicly available app.

🔹 Why This Curve Works

-Not overloading myself → each phase teaches skills in context.

-Avoiding the trap of “building without design” or “design without requirements.”

-Having have a portfolio-ready project at the end.

⚡ Note to myself: While learning Figma, also sketch out the data flow (like ERD + user flows) inside the app → it will make Laravel implementation smoother because I will already know how data moves.
